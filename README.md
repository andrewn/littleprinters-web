# Little Printers

This is a port of [Nord Projects's](https://nordprojects.co/) amazing [Little Printers iOS app](https://github.com/nordprojects/littleprinters-ios-app) to the web. [Read more about the project.](https://nordprojects.co/projects/littleprinters/)

The web app is deployed at https://littleprinters.netlify.com/.

It's a very rough implementation that needs some UI polish.

## Current features

- [x] Add/delete printers
- [x] Poster Font message
- [ ] Quick Draw message
- [ ] Dithergram message

## Credits

The UI assets, design and features are all taken from the existing iOS app. I just ported them to the web.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
